Checklist for making a new release:

- Run test suite on as many machines as possible.
- Update the version number to the new M.m.r value in coord/_version.py
- Read over the CHANGELOG.rst file and edit as needed.
- Update any docs that might need updating.
- Make sure the current code is installed:  e.g.
    python setup.py install --prefix=~
- Generate current docs
    update_docs
- Commit and push new docs.  (Assuming there were any changes from the last time this was done.)
    git add docs/_build
    git commit -m "update docs"
- Tag the current version
    git tag -a vM.m.r -m "vM.m.r"
    git push --tags
- Make the corresponding release branch in case we need to do any bug fixes.  (Assuming this is
  a new minor release, not just a revision.)
    git checkout -b releases/M.m
    git push -u origin releases/M.m
- Get the current version onto pip.  (Maybe check again that the current version is installed!)
    python setup.py sdist upload
    pip install -UI LSSTDESC.Coord --user  (To test that it worked)
- Back in main, update version number to M.(m+1) (i.e. no .r)
- Move the CHANGELOG information into docs/history.rst and clear out the current CHANGELOG.rst
  file for the next version.
