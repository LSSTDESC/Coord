Notes on setting up Sphinx and publishing the docs on GitHub.

First install Sphinx following the instructions here:

http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/tutorial.html

On a new project, run sphinx-quickstart.  (This has already been done here.)
I used the default answers except for
Project name: Coord
Project version: 1.0 (although I don't think it uses this anywhere)
autodoc: y
doctest: y
mathjax: y
viewcode: y
Create Windows command file: n


The *.rst files in this directory constitute the source files for the documentation.
As you can see, they mostly consist of importing the inline documentation from the
classes and function definitions.  But you can add any additional documentation
that you want in these files and Sphinx will render it for you.


On GitHub, in the Settings, Options, GitHub Pages panel, select source:
"master branch /docs folder".  This will make the /docs directory the root of the
gh-pages site, so I use an index.html in this directory that just redirects to the
_build/html/index.html file that Sphix builds.


To update the documentation, run update_docs in this directory, commit and push.
If this is for a new version, update the version number in the Makefile.
