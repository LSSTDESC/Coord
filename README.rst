# Overview

This module has classes that provide basic functionality related to celestial coordinates.

They were originally written by Mike Jarvis for TreeCorr and then also used in GalSim.
They are republished here as a stand-alone module.

# DESC DE School

There are unit tests for these classes in both the TreeCorr and GalSim repositories.  However,
I have intentionally not ported them over, so that I can use this module as a pedagogical tool
for teaching about unit tests at the July 10, 2017 DE School.

Participants in the DE School should probably not look at the unit tests in these other repos if
they want to get the most out of the lesson.
